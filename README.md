# Smart-Player-Recommendation-System

## Objectives:
1. **Data Cleaning:** The dataset will be cleaned by removing irrelevant data, fixing incorrect data 
types, handling missing values, and dealing with outliers.
2. **Data Reduction:** The dataset will be reduced by selecting relevant features, eliminating redundant 
data, and reducing the dimensionality of the dataset.
3. **Data Discretization:** The dataset will be discretized by dividing continuous data into discrete 
intervals to simplify the dataset.
4. **Data Normalization:** The dataset will be normalized to eliminate inconsistencies in the data due 
to varying scales.
5. **Clustering:** The dataset will be clustered to group similar players together based on their attributes.
6. **Recommendation Engine:** The recommendation engine will be developed using the clustered 
dataset to suggest players to users based on their preferences and gameplay style.

## Deliverables:
1. Cleaned and pre-processed FIFA dataset.
2. Reduced and discretized dataset.
3. Normalized dataset.
4. Clustered dataset.
5. Player recommendation engine.
6. Project Report (methodology, results, and analysis of the project).

## Novelty:
Our project presents a novel approach to clustering the FIFA Players Dataset, which differs 
from previous studies that have used Fuzzy-C clustering. Instead, we opted for hierarchical 
clustering using K-means. Moreover, we clustered players not just based on their individual 
skill attributes, but also based on their overall and potential ratings, which were classified into 
three categories: good players, average players, and poor players. We then performed 
clustering on each of these categories to obtain clusters of players based on their positions: 
goalkeeper, defenders, midfielders, and forwards. This approach offers a more comprehensive 
perspective on player performance and takes into account multiple factors that impact a 
player's contribution to the team.
By clustering players in this way, our project can provide valuable insights and 
recommendations to football clubs and scouting agencies looking to optimize their team rosters 
by identifying suitable players that match their requirements. We believe that our methodology 
has the potential to contribute to the development of more sophisticated player 
recommendation systems in the future.
In addition, our project can also be useful for football game developers who want to improve 
the realism of player attributes and ratings in their games. By using our clustering approach, 
they can create more accurate and realistic player models that better reflect their on-field 
performance.
Overall, our project stands out for its unique approach to clustering football players based on 
multiple attributes and has the potential to benefit various stakeholders in the football industry.
